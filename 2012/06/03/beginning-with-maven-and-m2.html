From my experience, there are three kinds of developers today: those that never heard about Maven, those that hate it and those that can&#39;t live without it. For a long time I was in the second group and I just recently turned to the third one, and I&#39;m slowly dragging all my fellow programmers with me!</p>
<p>At first I was reluctant but then, at work, forced to make Java more efficient and develop at a faster pace, I decided to try it out (again, for the [big number here] time). But this time I was determined to make it work. I bought a book, created a bunch of test projects and learned a lot about it! Today, I can&#39;t think of starting a new project without it.</p>

<p>This post is the first one on what will probably become a series of posts about the lessons learned on using Maven with Eclipse, from single simple projects to huge enterprise multi-module projects. The code for this example can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">blog repository in github</a>.</p>
<p>I started to use SpringSource Tool Suite (STS), that comes with Maven. STS uses M2, that&#39;s a Maven plugin for Eclipse. If you don&#39;t want to use STS, you can download and use this plugin and you&#39;ll have the same functionality that I&#39;ll describe here. You&#39;ll also need to download Maven separately. It won&#39;t make any difference for what we&#39;ll do in this project but I highly recommend adding Maven <em>bin</em> directory to your command line path. Most of the time, when using M2 you won&#39;t need to run Maven from the command line, you can run it directly from within Eclipse.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-maven-project">Creating a new Maven Project</h2>
<p>To create a Maven project using M2 is very simple. If you don&#39;t have a specific archetype to use (most of the time you won&#39;t have one), these are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<h3 id="step-1-start-new-project-wizard">Step 1 - Start new project wizard</h3>
<p>Start the create new project wizard, either going to the menu <em>File &gt; New &gt; Other...</em> or <em>{Right Click on Package Explorer} &gt; New &gt; Other...</em>.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-select-maven-project">Step 2 - Select Maven Project</h3>
<p>From the list, select <em>Maven &gt; Maven Project</em> and click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/Create Maven Project - Step 1.png" alt="Create Maven Project - Step 1"></p>
<h3 id="step-3-select-project-location">Step 3 - Select Project Location</h3>
<p>On the next screen, check the <em>Create a simple project</em> checkbox to skip archetype selection. </p>
<p>If you want to put your project somewhere other then your workspace directory, you can select where you want it to be. In this case, I&#39;m setting up a different directory. </p>
<p>Click <em>Next</em></p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/Create Maven Project - Step 2.png" alt="Create Maven Project - Step 2"></p>
<h3 id="step-4-give-your-new-project-a-name">Step 4 - Give your new project a name</h3>
<p>Maven uses three coordinates to identify a project: group ID, artifact Id and version. </p>
<p>One Group can have many different artifacts, for example, Group <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3Aorg.springframework">org.springframework</a> contains the many different artifacts for the Spring Framework project.</p>
<p>The artifact ID identifies the artifact that will be generated by the project. Normally this is the same as the project name, but it doesn&#39;t need to be. The artifact that will be generated by your project can be many different things, including (I&#39;ll explain this better in a future post): POM, JAR, WAR, EAR, etc. It will depend on what your project is. </p>
<p>Each combination of group:artifact can have more than one version. When you create a dependency between two projects, you need to say what version you want to use (or use LATEST or SNAPSHOT, if you feel adventurous). If you release a new version of your artifact, people that didn&#39;t use LATEST need to explicitly change their dependency declaration so that they&#39;ll use the newest one.</p>
<p>On the <em>Configure Project</em> screen you&#39;ll need to give your project all three coordinates and also a name and a packaging type. As I already mentioned, most of the times you&#39;ll use the project name the same as the artifact ID, but that&#39;s not a requirement. The packaging type in this case I selected WAR, meaning that I&#39;m creating a web application. Maven knows, from this, what it needs to generate and how to package the contents of the project. M2 will also use the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/">Maven Eclipse plugin</a> to generate the <code>.project</code>, <code>.classpath</code> and other configuration files that Eclipse needs to import your project to your workspace.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a good practice to give your project a meaningful description.</p>
<p>Click <em>Finish</em></p>

<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>After your project is created and imported, you&#39;ll see the following structure:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/Maven Web Project Structure.png" alt="Maven Web Project Structure"></p>
<p>Maven creates four folders for source files and add them as source folders. It also generated a fifth source folder, <code>main/webapp</code>, this is the root of your web application, where you&#39;ll put all your resources: html, javascript, etc. It also created a <code>WEB-INF</code> folder, as expected. It didn&#39;t generated the web.xml, so you&#39;ll need to do that yourself.</p>
<p>To create your own <code>web.xml</code> file you can <em>{Right click the WEB-INF folder} &gt; New...</em> and select <em>XML File</em>. The following is an example of an empty <code>web.xml</code> file that uses the new 3.0 servlet specification:</p>
