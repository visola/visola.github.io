It runs on top of the V8 engine, which is the engine that runs inside the Chromium and Chrome browsers.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s learn more details about what all of this means.</p>

<h2 id="piece-by-piece">Piece by Piece</h2>
<p>V8 is an engine that interpret Javascript code. That means that you give it some Javascript text and it will execute it. And since it&#39;s high performance, it will do it really fast in a very efficient way.</p>
<p>Even though V8 can execute Javascript, it doesn&#39;t provide you with any APIs to do anything that&#39;s really useful, like reading and writing to files, for example. It only knows how to interpret Javascript code according to the ECMAScript standards.</p>
<p>That&#39;s where Node.js comes in. Node provides a set of APIs to do all sorts of useful things, including reading and writing from files in the disk. It also provides a runtime environment where you code can run in. This means that you can write a simple Javascript file and ask Node.js to run it.</p>
<p>Node.js is a command line tool, which means you have to run it from the terminal. That&#39;s not a big deal because the command is really simple and there&#39;s not a big learning curve there, just some extra typing.</p>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll need to do is go to <a href="nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>, download and install node for your platform. And that&#39;s it, you&#39;re ready to go.</p>
<h2 id="simple-application">Simple application</h2>
<p>So let&#39;s just see how building a simple application in Node.js works.</p>
<p>Suppose that you want to write an application that reads text from files and print it on the console. The way it will work is that you&#39;ll give a filename as the input and the application will just print out all the text on the console.</p>
<p>For this example, we&#39;ll be using the following parts of the Node.js API:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_createreadstream_path_options">FileSystem#createReadStream</a> - this function creates a stream that reads bytes from a file.</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_argv">Process#argv</a> - to get the arguments passed in from the command line to our application.</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/readline.html#readline_readline_createinterface_options">Readline#createInterface</a> - used to create a readline interface that read byte streams, convert them to characters and emit an event for each line in the file.</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/readline.html#readline_event_line">Readline line event</a> - the line event is the one we&#39;ll listen to to get the lines from the text file we&#39;re going to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following snippet shows how you combine the API&#39;s mentioned above to build this simple application. Save it on a file called <code>print_output.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fileSystem = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'fs'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> readline = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'readline'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> lineReader = readline.createInterface({
  input: fileSystem.createReadStream(process.argv[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>])
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> counter = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
lineReader.on(<span class="hljs-string">'line'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">line</span>) </span>{
  counter++;
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(counter + <span class="hljs-string">': '</span> + line);
});
</code></pre>
<p>In the same directory, create a file called <code>example.txt</code> and put the following content inside it:</p>
<pre><code>Some example text on the first line.
A second line with some more text.
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s going to be the sample text file that our application will read.</p>
<p>After that run the following command from inside that directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ node print_file.js example.txt
</code></pre><p>You&#39;ll see that the application will print all lines in the file, each one in a new line and also prints the line number before them, using the <code>counter</code> variable. Here is an example output:</p>
<pre><code>$ node print_file.js example.txt
1: Some example text on the first line.
2: A second line with some more text.
</code></pre><p>A few basic things that you&#39;ll need to keep in mind when working with Node.js:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>require</code> is used to import modules that you can use. This is how you tap into Node.js&#39; API and other dependencies (more about that in future posts)</li>
<li><code>console.log</code> is what you use to print to the standard out. Just like you would do in a browser (more details in Node.js&#39; <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/console.html">Console API</a>)</li>
<li>Node.js does most things asynchronously, mostly I/O operations like reading a file (unless you explicitly ask it not to). If you add a <code>console.log</code> after the <code>line.on</code> call, you&#39;ll see that the output will come before the file lines. That&#39;s because, similarly to what happens in the browser, that code will be put on a queue to be executed when the line is actually available.</li>
