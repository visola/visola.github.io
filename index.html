This post is my way to change that, meaning that I&#39;m trying to learn OSGi deeper and start getting things done using this platform.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do is to have a good experience with tooling and get Maven to work for me, not against me. This post is showing a simple example on how to configure Maven to generate an OSGi bundle and how to use Declarative Services and Apache Felix Http Whiteboard to quickly deploy a simple servlet.</p>
<p>The code for this post is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">git repository</a> under the project <code>osgi-maven-example</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="Simple Caching with Spring" href="2012/07/22/Simple Caching with Spring.html">Simple Caching with Spring</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-07-22</p><p>This week an old friend contacted me because he was having memory problems in one of his applications. The problem was very simple: for each user logged in, all application menus and part of the list/combo values were being added to the user session (including some images). That was used to makes things faster, to avoid going to the database multiple times and loading the data all over again.</p>
<p>The problem with that approach is that each user will have a copy of the data in memory. And in this case, it&#39;s the same data, copied over and over again. After some time, if traffic increases, the JVM will run out of memory. And the situation gets worth when users don&#39;t click the <em>logout</em> button/link, meaning that the session will get stuck until the timeout period has finished.</p>
<p>To help him I wrote a simple example - that was extended in this post - to demonstrate one approach (there are certainly many others) to cache data in a Spring application. What this example will show is how you can use an extra bean to keep the data cached and up-to-date at the same time.</p>
<p>Source code for this example is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">github repository</a> under the folder <code>simple-cache</code>.</p>
<p>This post is not about the new Cache Abstraction provided in Spring 3.1.</p>
<h2><a name="Customizing Spring Security" href="2012/07/20/Customizing Spring Security.html">Customizing Spring Security</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-07-20</p><p><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/">Spring Security</a> is a very powerful and customizable security framework for JEE applications. This post will show how to integrate it seamlessly with your application setting up a custom login and logout.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also learn how to add a custom filter with very specific behavior and how to integrate with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa">Spring Data</a> so that your users can be loaded from a repository and avoid all the hassle of dealing with JDBC or Hibernate.</p>
<p>The code for this example can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">GitHub Repository</a>. For this post, there are three projects involved: <code>root</code>, <code>spring-security-first-user</code> and <code>user-model</code>. The root project contains dependency management and the user-model can be reused for any other project involving spring security.</p>
<h2><a name="Beginning with Maven and M2" href="2012/06/03/Beginning with Maven and M2.html">Beginning with Maven and M2</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-06-03</p><p>Apache Maven, in my opinion, is one of the most controversial tools around. From my experience, there are three kinds of developers today: those that never heard about Maven, those that hate it and those that can&#39;t live without it. For a long time I was in the second group and I just recently turned to the third one, and I&#39;m slowly dragging all my fellow programmers with me!</p>
<p>At first I was reluctant but then, at work, forced to make Java more efficient and develop at a faster pace, I decided to try it out (again, for the [big number here] time). But this time I was determined to make it work. I bought a book, created a bunch of test projects and learned a lot about it! Today, I can&#39;t think of starting a new project without it.</p>
<h2><a name="Bean Validation (JSR-303) and Spring MVC" href="2012/04/14/Bean Validation (JSR-303) and Spring MVC.html">Bean Validation (JSR-303) and Spring MVC</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-04-14</p><p>The code for this example can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">blog repository in github</a>.</p>
<p>Validation in web applications normally spread through many lines of code in the client side and in the server side. JSR-303, or Bean Validation, is a standard developed to be part of JPA. It&#39;s a simple and generic way to annotate your entities with specific validation rules and have them validated by some validation engine.</p>
<p>Hibernate started with validation through annotations and JSR-303 was highly influenced by it (probably completely driven by it). Part of JEE 6, for those who are not using a complete JEE server (like Tomcat), the API can be found in one of Hibernate&#39;s artifact:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">dependency</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">groupId</span>&gt;</span>org.hibernate<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">groupId</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">artifactId</span>&gt;</span>hibernate-validator<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">artifactId</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">version</span>&gt;</span>4.2.0.Final<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">version</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">dependency</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Spring MVC 3 added full support for validation using JSR-303. So the same validation that you use in the persistence layer can also be used in your web layer, at least in the server side. This example will show a simple application that uses Bean Validation to validate a bean before saving it.</p>
