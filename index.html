<p>Spring MVC is one of the easiest and most powerful MVC framework to build web applications in Java. With all the features that it has available it is impossible to know everything. But in most cases, when you ask the question: &quot;Can Spring MVC do [put something complex and unexpected here]?&quot; the answer is yes. And when it can&#39;t, the answer is: it has a place for you to hook your code in and do whatever you need.</p>
<p>Recently, having a conversation with one of my friends that is using Spring MVC and Spring Data in a new project for the company he works, he stumbled into the @ModelAttribute annotation and asked me if I knew how to use it. My answer was that I&#39;ve never heard about it before but I was going to take a look into it. What I found was a solution to an old problem that I had but I&#39;ve never thought that Spring MVC would have a solution for it.</p>
<p>The problem I faced in a recent application I worked on was that I had a relatively large entity with a few sub-entities in it. When I build the form in the JSP page to send to server, I had to put in the form all kinds of information in hidden fields so that my entity didn&#39;t get updated by mistake with a null value (like a created or last updated field). And I still needed to do more because I had all those sub-entities that needed to be loaded and correctly filled (or put all fields in the form, even those I wouldn&#39;t need in the page). The result was a large HTML with unnecessary data being passed around and unnecessary complex code in the controller to process all those details.</p>
<p>The @ModelAttribute exist to solve this kind of problem. The way it works is that you can annotate one (or more) of the methods in your controller as a model attribute, meaning that it will contribute some attribute to the model. In this post I&#39;m going to show how to use it and what are the details associated with it.</p>
