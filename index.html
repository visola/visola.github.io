I thought it was just a <em>new way to refer to the same thing</em>. Of course I was wrong. A couple of years later I started to use Spring Data and again I was confronted with the <em>Repository</em> a <em>different name for the same thing</em>, at least that was what I thought, and again, I was wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the kind of person that settles down until I get a complete answer for the problem, I really hate when I don&#39;t have a precise and detailed answer. That&#39;s why I decided to take some time and research deeper and write down my findings for all of you that are thinking the same way and get lost every time you need to name your data access layer objects.</p>
<p>Some may say: <em>How can you get confused about something that is clearly different?</em> If you think that, then this post is not for you, unless you want to help me review my content (what I would appreciate). But if you&#39;re like me and have been writing small (10-15 model classes) web applications you&#39;re probably standing where I am: your <em>data layer</em> has some characteristics of all three patterns.</p>

Well, this project is a simple example on how to get a MVC working with a database using a singleton that will generate a data source for you.</p>
<p>As usual the code is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/">github repository</a> under <code>simple-web-mvc</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="OSGi Maven and Servlet" href="2012/07/31/OSGi Maven and Servlet.html">OSGi Maven and Servlet</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-07-31</p><p>I tried a few times before to start developing using OSGi but never had a chance to work with it in the real life so it&#39;s hard to get all the concepts to stick in my head. This post is my way to change that, meaning that I&#39;m trying to learn OSGi deeper and start getting things done using this platform.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do is to have a good experience with tooling and get Maven to work for me, not against me. This post is showing a simple example on how to configure Maven to generate an OSGi bundle and how to use Declarative Services and Apache Felix Http Whiteboard to quickly deploy a simple servlet.</p>
<p>The code for this post is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">git repository</a> under the project <code>osgi-maven-example</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="Simple Caching with Spring" href="2012/07/22/Simple Caching with Spring.html">Simple Caching with Spring</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-07-22</p><p>This week an old friend contacted me because he was having memory problems in one of his applications. The problem was very simple: for each user logged in, all application menus and part of the list/combo values were being added to the user session (including some images). That was used to makes things faster, to avoid going to the database multiple times and loading the data all over again.</p>
<p>The problem with that approach is that each user will have a copy of the data in memory. And in this case, it&#39;s the same data, copied over and over again. After some time, if traffic increases, the JVM will run out of memory. And the situation gets worth when users don&#39;t click the <em>logout</em> button/link, meaning that the session will get stuck until the timeout period has finished.</p>
<p>To help him I wrote a simple example - that was extended in this post - to demonstrate one approach (there are certainly many others) to cache data in a Spring application. What this example will show is how you can use an extra bean to keep the data cached and up-to-date at the same time.</p>
<p>Source code for this example is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">github repository</a> under the folder <code>simple-cache</code>.</p>
<p>This post is not about the new Cache Abstraction provided in Spring 3.1.</p>
<h2><a name="Customizing Spring Security" href="2012/07/20/Customizing Spring Security.html">Customizing Spring Security</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-07-20</p><p><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/">Spring Security</a> is a very powerful and customizable security framework for JEE applications. This post will show how to integrate it seamlessly with your application setting up a custom login and logout.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also learn how to add a custom filter with very specific behavior and how to integrate with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa">Spring Data</a> so that your users can be loaded from a repository and avoid all the hassle of dealing with JDBC or Hibernate.</p>
<p>The code for this example can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">GitHub Repository</a>. For this post, there are three projects involved: <code>root</code>, <code>spring-security-first-user</code> and <code>user-model</code>. The root project contains dependency management and the user-model can be reused for any other project involving spring security.</p>
