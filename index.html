XML tags are translated to Java objects and executed calling methods in the objects created. The following image illustrates the relationship between the XML and the Java objects:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/ant-xml-to-java.png" alt="Ant xml to java"></p>
<p>A project built with Ant begins with a <code>build.xml</code> file where you describe all targets. A target is a set of tasks and can depend on other targets. When you run an Ant build, you tell it what target you want to execute. Ant then creates a target dependency tree for your project, calculates the least amount of targets necessary to get to the requested target and starts executing them from the target that has no dependencies. The build is considered finished when the requested target gets executed or some target failed.</p>
<p>In this post I&#39;ll explain the two things that I found not so well documented and lacking clear explanation on how to do it: dependency management and code coverage measurement with Jacoco. This was part of the project that I worked on to compare the <a href="http://bearprogrammer.com/2013/12/17/build-tools-for-java/&quot;" title="Build tools for Java">three mainstream Java build tools</a>. The code for this post can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples/tree/master/build-tools/sample-ant">github repository</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Build tools for Java" href="2013/12/17/Build tools for Java.html">Build tools for Java</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2013-12-17</p><p>More than a year ago <a href="/2012/06/03/Beginning with Maven and M2.html" title="Beginning with Maven and M2">I wrote a post about</a> how I started to use Maven to build my Java applications and how much I loved it! Things changed a lot since then and I, like many others, am moving my projects to <a href="http://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a>. In this post - and a few more to come - I&#39;ll be talking about build tools for Java and make some comparisons and explain why I moved to Gradle.</p>
<p>This content started from a recent presentation that I gave at work about build tools. The idea was to make a comparison between the three most widespread build tools for Java: <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> and Gradle. I thought it would be cool to have a project - simple but with some complex dependencies - built using all three of them. With that it would be easy to compare, apples to apples, how each one works and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each one.</p>
<h2><a name="DAO, Repository and Service, digging deeper" href="2012/11/12/DAO, Repository and Service, digging deeper.html">DAO, Repository and Service, digging deeper</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-11-12</p><p>The first time I heard the term <em>service layer</em> I was intrigued by it because I always used a <em>Data Access Object</em> to access  my data. I thought it was just a <em>new way to refer to the same thing</em>. Of course I was wrong. A couple of years later I started to use Spring Data and again I was confronted with the <em>Repository</em> a <em>different name for the same thing</em>, at least that was what I thought, and again, I was wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the kind of person that settles down until I get a complete answer for the problem, I really hate when I don&#39;t have a precise and detailed answer. That&#39;s why I decided to take some time and research deeper and write down my findings for all of you that are thinking the same way and get lost every time you need to name your data access layer objects.</p>
<p>Some may say: <em>How can you get confused about something that is clearly different?</em> If you think that, then this post is not for you, unless you want to help me review my content (what I would appreciate). But if you&#39;re like me and have been writing small (10-15 model classes) web applications you&#39;re probably standing where I am: your <em>data layer</em> has some characteristics of all three patterns.</p>
<h2><a name="Simple web MVC with servlets and JSP" href="2012/08/05/Simple web MVC with servlets and JSP.html">Simple web MVC with servlets and JSP</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-08-05</p><p>A while ago a friend of mine that is starting with web development in Java asked me what is the best way to write a web application in Java if you can&#39;t understand a framework like Spring or JSF or if you just don&#39;t want to use them? Well, this project is a simple example on how to get a MVC working with a database using a singleton that will generate a data source for you.</p>
<p>As usual the code is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/">github repository</a> under <code>simple-web-mvc</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="OSGi Maven and Servlet" href="2012/07/31/OSGi Maven and Servlet.html">OSGi Maven and Servlet</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2012-07-31</p><p>I tried a few times before to start developing using OSGi but never had a chance to work with it in the real life so it&#39;s hard to get all the concepts to stick in my head. This post is my way to change that, meaning that I&#39;m trying to learn OSGi deeper and start getting things done using this platform.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do is to have a good experience with tooling and get Maven to work for me, not against me. This post is showing a simple example on how to configure Maven to generate an OSGi bundle and how to use Declarative Services and Apache Felix Http Whiteboard to quickly deploy a simple servlet.</p>
<p>The code for this post is in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples">git repository</a> under the project <code>osgi-maven-example</code>.</p>
