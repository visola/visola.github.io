In this part of the two posts I&#39;m going to explain how to setup and use Backbone in a single page application while separating your code in a way that it will be simple to maintain and add new features.</p>
<p>The first part of this tutorial lives <a href="http://wp.me/p2iway-6p">here</a>. The code for this post lives in my Blog&#39;s GitHub repository under <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples/tree/master/require-js-backbone">require-js-backbone</a>.</p>
</section><section class="post"><h2><a name="RequireJS and Backbone on a Single Page Application - Part 1" href="2015/11/04/requirejs-and-backbone-on-a-single-page-application-part-1/index.html">RequireJS and Backbone on a Single Page Application - Part 1</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2015-11-04 by Vinicius Isola</p><p>Building single page applications isn&#39;t easy. As the app grows and gets more complex your Javascript code gets harder to maintain and duplicate logic start spreading all over the place. Breaking your code in well defined and self contained small modules help to keep the complexity low and organize the logic in an encapsulated and predictable way. But to do that it means that you now need some kind of dependency management system in place.</p>
<p><a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> helps you with that. With it, creating new modules is as easy as calling a function and declaring dependency is as easy as passing an argument to that function.</p>
<p>But managing dependencies is just part of the problem. You still have a lot of code to make requests to your REST APIs, handle the rendering of the content on the page and user interactions.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, a Javascript framework that has many of those basic features every app needs. It also helps with the task of organizing your code and keeping clear separation of concerns.</p>
<p>In these two blog posts (the one you&#39;re reading and <a href="http://wp.me/p2iway-6M">this</a>) I&#39;m going to show a simple example of how to configure and use these two frameworks together in a way that makes it really easy to build well separated and reusable components. On the first post I&#39;ll talk about how RequireJS works and how to configure and use it. On the second post I&#39;m going to show how to add backbone to the mix and how to organize the code in a way that it&#39;s easy to maintain and extend.</p>

It contains a lot more than what is explained here and I hope to come back to it in later posts. The code can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples/tree/master/complete-to-do">Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>For this post I&#39;ll be focusing on how you can test a web application using Cucumber and Selenium. I&#39;ll be using the <a href="https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty/">Gretty</a> plugin to start a web container during the build. I&#39;ve picked this plugin because of the built-in setup for integration tests.</p>

Similarly with Ant, where you have a XML namespace to write build scripts, Gradle is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> on top of Groovy that helps you write build scripts. But it goes further with many plugins and conventions (like Maven) that make it possible to get a build up and running with just a few lines of Groovy.</p>
<p>A Gradle build starts with a <code>build.gradle</code> file. This file contains plugins that you apply to your build, dependencies that your project need to compile, package and run, repositories where your dependencies will be loaded from, plugin configurations and custom tasks. All those are written with a cleverly build model that makes your build scripts readable, maintainable and easy to extend.</p>
<p>In this post I&#39;ll cover the gradle build from the three sample projects that I worked on to compare the <a href="http://bearprogrammer.com/2013/12/17/build-tools-for-java">three mainstream Java build tools</a>. The code for this post can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/visola/bearprogrammer-examples/tree/master/build-tools/sample-gradle">github repository</a>.</p>
</section><section class="post"><h2><a name="Building with Ant" href="2014/03/22/building-with-ant/index.html">Building with Ant</a></h2><p class="published">Published on 2014-03-22 by Vinicius Isola</p><p>Ant has been around for a while now (first released in 2000) and it can be compared with a scripting language written in XML. XML tags are translated to Java objects and executed calling methods in the objects created. The following image illustrates the relationship between the XML and the Java objects:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/ant-xml-to-java.png" alt="Ant xml to java"></p>
<p>A project built with Ant begins with a <code>build.xml</code> file where you describe all targets. A target is a set of tasks and can depend on other targets. When you run an Ant build, you tell it what target you want to execute. Ant then creates a target dependency tree for your project, calculates the least amount of targets necessary to get to the requested target and starts executing them from the target that has no dependencies. The build is considered finished when the requested target gets executed or some target failed.</p>
<p>In this post I&#39;ll explain the two things that I found not so well documented and lacking clear explanation on how to do it: dependency management and code coverage measurement with Jacoco. This was part of the project that I worked on to compare the <a href="http://bearprogrammer.com/2013/12/17/build-tools-for-java/&quot;" title="Build tools for Java">three mainstream Java build tools</a>.

Things changed a lot since then and I, like many others, am moving my projects to <a href="http://www.gradle.org">Gradle</a>. In this post - and a few more to come - I&#39;ll be talking about build tools for Java and make some comparisons and explain why I moved to Gradle.</p>
<p>This content started from a recent presentation that I gave at work about build tools. The idea was to make a comparison between the three most widespread build tools for Java: <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> and Gradle. I thought it would be cool to have a project - simple but with some complex dependencies - built using all three of them. With that it would be easy to compare, apples to apples, how each one works and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each one.</p>

I thought it was just a <em>new way to refer to the same thing</em>. Of course I was wrong. A couple of years later I started to use Spring Data and again I was confronted with the <em>Repository</em> a <em>different name for the same thing</em>, at least that was what I thought, and again, I was wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the kind of person that settles down until I get a complete answer for the problem, I really hate when I don&#39;t have a precise and detailed answer. That&#39;s why I decided to take some time and research deeper and write down my findings for all of you that are thinking the same way and get lost every time you need to name your data access layer objects.</p>
<p>Some may say: <em>How can you get confused about something that is clearly different?</em> If you think that, then this post is not for you, unless you want to help me review my content (what I would appreciate). But if you&#39;re like me and have been writing small (10-15 model classes) web applications you&#39;re probably standing where I am: your <em>data layer</em> has some characteristics of all three patterns.</p>

This post is my way to change that, meaning that I&#39;m trying to learn OSGi deeper and start getting things done using this platform.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do is to have a good experience with tooling and get Maven to work for me, not against me. This post is showing a simple example on how to configure Maven to generate an OSGi bundle and how to use Declarative Services and Apache Felix Http Whiteboard to quickly deploy a simple servlet.</p>
