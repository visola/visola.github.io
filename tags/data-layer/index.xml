      <description>The first time I heard the term service layer I was intrigued by it because I always used a Data Access Object to access my data. I thought it was just a new way to refer to the same thing. Of course I was wrong. A couple of years later I started to use Spring Data and again I was confronted with the Repository a different name for the same thing, at least that was what I thought, and again, I was wrong.</description>
