      <description>Ant has been around for a while now (first released in 2000) and it can be compared with a scripting language written in XML. XML tags are translated to Java objects and executed calling methods in the objects created. The following image illustrates the relationship between the XML and the Java objects:
A project built with Ant begins with a build.xml file where you describe all targets. A target is a set of tasks and can depend on other targets.</description>

      <description>More than a year ago I wrote a post about how I started to use Maven to build my Java applications and how much I loved it! Things changed a lot since then and I, like many others, am moving my projects to Gradle. In this post - and a few more to come - I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about build tools for Java and make some comparisons and explain why I moved to Gradle.</description>
