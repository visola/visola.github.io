      <h2><a href="/posts/2013-12-17-build-tools-for-java/">Build tools for Java</a></h2>
      <p class="published">December 17, 2013 by Vinicius Isola</p>
      More than a year ago I wrote a post about how I started to use Maven to build my Java applications and how much I loved it! Things changed a lot since then and I, like many others, am moving my projects to Gradle. In this post - and a few more to come - I&rsquo;ll be talking about build tools for Java and make some comparisons and explain why I moved to Gradle.

      <p class="published">July 31, 2012 by Vinicius Isola</p>
      I tried a few times before to start developing using OSGi but never had a chance to work with it in the real life so it&rsquo;s hard to get all the concepts to stick in my head. This post is my way to change that, meaning that I&rsquo;m trying to learn OSGi deeper and start getting things done using this platform.
The first thing I wanted to do is to have a good experience with tooling and get Maven to work for me, not against me.

      <p class="published">June 3, 2012 by Vinicius Isola</p>
      Apache Maven, in my opinion, is one of the most controversial tools around. From my experience, there are three kinds of developers today: those that never heard about Maven, those that hate it and those that can&rsquo;t live without it. For a long time I was in the second group and I just recently turned to the third one, and I&rsquo;m slowly dragging all my fellow programmers with me!
